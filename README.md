## Description:
Back in my second year of college, I got really into psychology. Instead of going back to school, I wanted to learn it on my own. I tried finding a simple guide like they have for computer science but couldn't. So, I'm making a free, easy-to-follow plan for a three-year BSc in Psychology. I'll gather materials from all around the internet and share them with everyone who wants to learn, without making it complicated.

## Project Goals:

Make a simple guide to learn BSc Psychology.

Collect free stuff from good universities and All around internet for everyone to use.


Make a simple and organized place on GitHub for easy learning.


Keep it good quality while keeping it all free.


Build a friendly group for people to help each other learn.

## Key Features:

Three-year plan to learn psychology, split into parts.


Free stuff from reputed universities.

Everything is free so everyone can learn.

Updates and help from a growing group.

Contents are of top notch quality.

## How to Help:

Fork the Project.

Tell us what could be better or what's missing.

Share your own stuff or suggest good things to add.

Talk with others to make the guide better.

** Note: **

This is just a project made by regular people, not by any university. The goal is to help everyone learn psychology without needing a lot of money. Everyone is welcome to join!

**Courses must**:
- Be open for enrollment

- Run regularly (ideally in self-paced format, otherwise running multiple times per year)

- Be of generally high quality in teaching materials and pedagogical principles

- Match the curricular standards of the [Bsc Psychology Curriculam ](https://backup.pondiuni.edu.in/sites/default/files/downloads/UG-App-Psychology270612.pdf): Curriculum Guidelines forBsc Degree in Psychology




**Duration**. It is possible to finish within about 3 years if you plan carefully and devote roughly 20 hours/week to your studies.

**Cost**. All or nearly all course material is available for free. However, some courses may charge money for assignments/tests/projects to be graded.
Note that both [Coursera](https://www.coursera.support/s/article/209819033-Apply-for-Financial-Aid-or-a-Scholarship?language=en_US) and [edX](https://courses.edx.org/financial-assistance/) offer financial aid.
