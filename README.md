## Introduction: ##
Hello and welcome to the Open Knowledge University's Psychology Course! This repository is a labor of love born from the pursuit of knowledge and a passion for making quality education accessible to all. If you're here, you likely share the curiosity and enthusiasm for psychology that led me to embark on this journey.

## Background: ##
During my time in college, studying for an honors degree in accounts, I discovered a deep interest in psychology. Unfortunately, time constraints prevented me from pursuing formal studies in psychology at another university. Undeterred, I scoured the internet for high-quality psychology resources that were freely available. Lucky for me, I found some excellent materials that ignited my learning journey.

## The Initiative: ##
This repository is more than just a collection of resources; it's an initiative to empower individuals with a genuine interest in psychology. I am in the process of compiling resources that cover the entire three-year BSc degree curriculum. While I haven't gathered everything yet, I invite you to join me on this educational adventure.



## Project Goals:

Make a simple guide to learn BSc Psychology.

Collect free stuff from good universities and All around internet for everyone to use.


Make a simple and organized place on GitHub for easy learning.

Build a friendly group for people to help each other learn.

## Key Features:

Three-year plan to learn psychology, split into parts.


Free stuff from reputed universities.
