## Introduction: ##
Hello and welcome to the Open Knowledge University's Psychology Course! This repository is a labor of love born from the pursuit of knowledge and a passion for making quality education accessible to all. If you're here, you likely share the curiosity and enthusiasm for psychology that led me to embark on this journey.

## Background: ##
During my time in college, studying for an honors degree in accounts, I discovered a deep interest in psychology. Unfortunately, time constraints prevented me from pursuing formal studies in psychology at another university. Undeterred, I scoured the internet for high-quality psychology resources that were freely available. Lucky for me, I found some excellent materials that ignited my learning journey.

## The Initiative: ##
This repository is more than just a collection of resources; it's an initiative to empower individuals with a genuine interest in psychology. I am in the process of compiling resources that cover the entire three-year BSc degree curriculum. While I haven't gathered everything yet, I invite you to join me on this educational adventure.



## Project Goals:

Make a simple guide to learn BSc Psychology.

Collect free stuff from good universities and All around internet for everyone to use.


Make a simple and organized place on GitHub for easy learning.


Keep it good quality while keeping it all free.


Build a friendly group for people to help each other learn.

## Key Features:

Three-year plan to learn psychology, split into parts.


Free stuff from reputed universities.

Everything is free so everyone can learn.

Updates and help from a growing group.

Contents are of top notch quality.

## How to Help:

Fork the Project.

Tell us what could be better or what's missing.

Share your own stuff or suggest good things to add.

Talk with others to make the guide better.



**Courses must**:
- Be open for enrollment

- Run regularly (ideally in self-paced format, otherwise running multiple times per year)

- Be of generally high quality in teaching materials and pedagogical principles

- Match the curricular standards of the [Bsc Psychology Curriculam ](https://backup.pondiuni.edu.in/sites/default/files/downloads/UG-App-Psychology270612.pdf): Curriculum Guidelines forBsc Degree in Psychology




**Duration**. It is possible to finish within about 3 years if you plan carefully and devote roughly 20 hours/week to your studies.

**Cost**. All or nearly all course material is available for free. However, some courses may charge money for assignments/tests/projects to be graded.
Note that both [Coursera](https://www.coursera.support/s/article/209819033-Apply-for-Financial-Aid-or-a-Scholarship?language=en_US) and [edX](https://courses.edx.org/financial-assistance/) offer financial aid.




**Content policy**. If you plan on showing off some of your coursework publicly, you must share only files that you are allowed to.
*Respect the code of conduct* that you signed in the beginning of each course!

 **Note**.
 This repository serves as a supplementary tool for those who may not currently have access to formal education but are passionate about psychology. It is not a replacement for a recognized degree. Approach your educational journey with a holistic perspective, considering all available avenues for growth and learning.
